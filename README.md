## About BlackMarlinExec
BlackMarlinExec uses graph and analysis theory to reveal the hidden and unintended relationships within an Active Directory or Active Environment. CS can use BlackMarlinExec to easily identify highly complex attack paths that would otherwise be impossible to `quickly` identify. It also has it's own attack path management that continuously maps and quantifies Active Directory attack paths. CS can see thousand, even `millions` of attack paths within your existing architecture.

## BlackMarlinExec [Kerberos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3MxoxdzFNI&t=353s&ab_channel=Conda) Attack Performance
BlackMarlinExec incorporates a specialized [Kerberos](https://github.com/pxcs/KerberossianCracker) attack module, empowering CS to effectively test and exploit weaknesses within the Kerberos authentication protocol. This module is designed to enhance the enumeration and `analysis` capabilities by focusing on potential vulnerabilities in Kerberos implementations.

#### Ticket Harvesting by:

- AS-REP Roasting by automates the extraction of AS-REP responses for accounts that do not require pre-authentication.
- And kerberoasting to identifies and extracts service tickets (TGS) for services that leverage Kerberos.

By integrating advanced Kerberos attack techniques with [BME](https://github.com/pxcs/BlackMarlinExec/) powerful enumeration and network traffic analysis capabilities, CS would gain a holistic view of the network's security posture.<br>
<hr>

## Small Demonstration for [Roasting](https://github.com/pxcs/BlackMarlinExec/tree/main/bma/ABAMB/tunnel_barracuda)
During an enumeration attack, CS verify records stored in a `storage` using brute-force methods. These CS occur on `storage` that interact with web server databases after a user submits a form. The two most commonly targeted web app pages in enumeration attacks are login pages and `password` reset [pages.](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/tip/What-enumeration-attacks-are-and-how-to-prevent-them)

## Intro About [Barracuda](https://github.com/pxcs/BlackMarlinExec/blob/main/bma/ABAMB/README.md) Attack

#### TCP Killer
[Barracuda](https://github.com/pxcs/BlackMarlinExec/blob/main/bma/ABAMB/) is a utility to kill all TCP connections on a network. It works by intercepting network traffic, and forging RST packets of existing connections to cause hangups. Works for both IPv4 connections and IPv6. Barracuda ( TCPkiller ) is a sneaky way to kill network connections. Any targeted system will appear to work when examined through typical diagnostics - DNS will resolve, ICMP's will go through, and the network card will be able to connect ( slow ) to the network-but no TCP connections will be sustained.

## Main Features:
 - Shows a list of processes, and tcp ports they are listening to
 - The list can by filtered by port number
 - You can select a process, and terminate it
 
#### There are many tools that implement this functionality. This tool will additionally:
 - Resolve the application name of every processes ( if `jps` is available )
 - For IANA registered ports you can hover over the port number, and it will show additional information
 - On windows, will show the names of services running as children of `ABAMB.exe`
<br>

Shuts down a TCP connection on Linux, macOS, and Windows. Local and remote endpoint arguments can be copied from the output of `netstat_lanW.`

The functionality offered by *TCP_killer* is intended to mimic [TCPView](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/tcpview.aspx)'s "Close Connection" functionality and [TCPdrop](http://man.openbsd.org/tcpdrop.8)'s functionality on Linux and macOS.

## [LDAP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjpi8xYqPcY&pp=ygUUa2VyYmVyb3MgdnMga2VyYmVyb3M%3D) & Kerberos Protocol Potential Attacks
Using [BlackMarlinExec](https://github.com/pxcs/BlackMarlinExec/) to get benefits of integration. Firstly find a significant risk. A CS would try to "steal" user credentials through malware or AD Attacks using [BME](https://github.com/pxcs/BlackMarlinExec/), enabling them to `obtain` a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) and access network services. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks pose another threat, where an attacker intercepts communication using [BME](https://github.com/pxcs/BlackMarlinExec/) to get access between the user and the Key Distribution Center (KDC) or between services and the LDAP directory, potentially `stealing` or `modifying` data.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> [<img src="https://darkcitygame.com/images/thumb/c/c3/Kerberos.png/500px-Kerberos.png" width="30">]()
CS might steal user credentials through phishing, allowing them to get a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) and access network services. Another risk is ticket forgery, where an attacker creates fake tickets to impersonate users.<br><br>

> [!WARNING]
> [<img src="https://darkcitygame.com/images/thumb/c/c3/Kerberos.png/500px-Kerberos.png" width="30">]()
Security can intercept communications between users and the Key Distribution Center (KDC) or between services and the LDAP directory to steal or alter data. LDAP injection is another potential attack, where CS manipulate directory queries to access or change data `illegally.`<br>

## What is the Flaws in Kerberos?
Biggest lose was the assumption of secure time system, and resolution of synchronization required.

Users authenticate once with Kerberos and can `access` multiple services without re-entering credentials, thanks to the TGT. *Haha* this is the time when the CS could use this privileges for testing.
<br>

## [LDAP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2mQBXcW3P0&pp=ygUMTERBUCBhdHRhY2tz) Automatic Injections

Using ***BME*** to automate the process of detecting and exploiting LDAP injection vulnerabilities in AD scenario. With [BME](https://github.com/pxcs/BlackMarlinExec/), CS researcher can quickly identify and exploit LDAP injection flaws, allowing CS to assess the security posture of the applications more effectively.

## "More" Features

- Automated detection of LDAP injection vulnerabilities.
- Exploitation of LDAP injection vulnerabilities to extract sensitive information.
- Customizable payloads for fine-tuning injection attacks.

## Main Usage

```c
usage: BME [-h] [--command COMMAND] [--output OUTPUT] [--interface INTERFACE] [--port PORT]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --command COMMAND, -c COMMAND
                        command to run on the target (default: calc)
  --output OUTPUT, -o OUTPUT
                        output maldoc file (default: BME)
  --interface INTERFACE, -i INTERFACE
                        network interface or IP address to host the HTTP server (default: eth0)
  --port PORT, -p PORT  port to serve the HTTP server (default: 8000)
```

## Intercept all responses

Now, that you know how to start DNSChef let's configure it to fake all replies to point to 127.0.0.1 using the *--fakeip* parameter:

    # ./BME --fakeip 127.0.0.1 -q
    [*] BME started on interface: 127.0.0.1 
    [*] Using the following nameservers: x-x-x-x
    [*] Cooking all A replies to point to 127.0.0.1
    [23:55:57] 127.0.0.1: cooking the response of type 'A' for x-x-x-x.com to 127.0.0.1
    [23:55:57] 127.0.0.1: proxying the response of type 'AAAA' for x-x-x-x.com
    [23:55:57] 127.0.0.1: proxying the response of type 'MX' for x-x-x-x.com

In the above output you an see that BME was configured to proxy all requests to 127.0.0.1. The first line of log at 08:11:23 shows that we have "cooked" the "A" record response to point to 127.0.0.1. However, further requests for 'AAAA' and 'MX' records are simply proxied from a real DNS server. Let's see the output from requesting program:

    $ host google.com localhost
    x-x-x-x.com has address 127.0.0.1
    x-x-x-x.com has IPv6 address 2001:4860:4001:803::1001
    x-x-x-x.com mail is handled by 10 aspmx.l.x-x-x-x.com.
    x-x-x-x.com mail is handled by 40 alt3.aspmx.l.x-x-x-x.com.
    x-x-x-x.com mail is handled by 30 alt2.aspmx.l.x-x-x-x.com.

As you can see the program was tricked to use 127.0.0.1 for the IPv4 address. However, the information obtained from IPv6 (AAAA) and mail (MX) records appears completely legitimate. The goal of DNSChef is to have the least impact on the correct operation of the program, so if an application relies on a specific mailserver it will correctly obtain one through this proxied request.

Let's fake one more request to illustrate how to target multiple records at the same time:

    # ./BME --fakeip 127.0.0.1 --fakeipv6 ::1 -q
    [*] BME started on interface: 127.0.0.1 
    [*] Using the following nameservers: x-x-x-x
    [*] Cooking all A replies to point to 127.0.0.1
    [*] Cooking all AAAA replies to point to ::1
    [00:02:14] 127.0.0.1: cooking the response of type 'A' for x-x-x-x.com to 127.0.0.1
    [00:02:14] 127.0.0.1: cooking the response of type 'AAAA' for x-x-x-x.com to ::1
    [00:02:14] 127.0.0.1: proxying the response of type 'MX' for x-x-x-x.com

In addition to the --fakeip flag, I have now specified --fakeipv6 designed to fake 'AAAA' record queries. Here is an updated program output:

    $ host x-x-x-x.com localhost
    x-x-x-x.com has address 127.0.0.1
    x-x-x-x.com has IPv6 address ::1
    x-x-x-x.com mail is handled by 10 aspmx.l.x-x-x-x.com.
    x-x-x-x.com mail is handled by 40 alt3.aspmx.l.x-x-x-x.com.
    x-x-x-x.com mail is handled by 30 alt2.aspmx.l.x-x-x-x.com.

Once more all of the records not explicitly overriden by the application were proxied and returned from the real DNS server. However, IPv4 (A) and IPv6 (AAAA) were both faked to point to a local machine.

DNSChef supports multiple record types:

Record |  Description | Argument | Example
---|---|---|---
A     | IPv4 address |--fakeip   | --fakeip 127.0.0.1
AAAA  | IPv6 address |--fakeipv6 | --fakeipv6 2001:db8::1
MX    | Mail server  |--fakemail | --fakemail mail.x-x-x-x.com
CNAME | CNAME record |--fakealias| --fakealias www.x-x-x-x.com
NS    | Name server  |--fakens   | --fakens ns.x-x-x-x.com

***BlackMarlinExec*** is a cutting edge CS tool. Designed for comprehensive network traffic analysis and sophisticated enumeration, akin to the functionalities provided by harpoonhound. Developed for CS and penetration testers, BlackMarlinExec offers a robust suite of features tailored to identify, assess, and scan security vulnerabilities within complex network environments.<br><br>

## Network traffic analysis

#### Network Traffic Classification
This is a research project for classifying network traffic. We collected more than ***300000*** flows from some network. After that, we used nDPI to analyze the flows. We got more than 100 types of applications. Then we group that application into 10 classes. After that, we tried different ML algorithms to classify them.

#### Our current results

- Decision Tree `95.8%` accuracy
- Random Forest `96.69%` accuracy
- Regression `92.1%` accuracy
- Boosting `95.8%` accuracy
- Neural Net `97.5%` accuracy
- KNN `97.24%` accuracy
- PAA `99.29%` accuracy
- SVM `94.7%` accuracy

To get the dataset check out the instructions in the dataset folder.

#### How did we collect Data

***CS*** can use used [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) or [BlackMarlinExec](https://github.com/pxcs/BlackMarlinExec/) to collect the packets. Since for the project we wanted to use lab environment data, we first redirected the lab network to one personal computer(pc) and in that pc we used Wireshark. After collecting the packets, we used ndpi to analyze the packets and get extract flow info and then we export that data as an note file. The `data.csv` contains information on all parameters. However, for this project, we only used most important parameters as features.
